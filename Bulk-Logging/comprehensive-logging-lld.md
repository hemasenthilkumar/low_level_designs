- **Scalability**: Distribution, partitioning, fault tolerance
- **System Design**: Trade-offs, bottlenecks, monitoring

## 1. üèóÔ∏è Core Logger Design (Must-Know Patterns)

### Basic Thread-Safe Logger
```python
# Key patterns to implement & explain:
- Singleton: Single logger instance (thread-safe with __new__)
- Factory: Different logger types (FileLogger, ConsoleLogger)
- Strategy: Multiple formatters (JSON, Plain)
- Observer: Multiple appenders listening to events

# Python-specific considerations:
- threading.Lock vs threading.RLock
- queue.Queue vs collections.deque
- multiprocessing vs threading for I/O bound tasks
```

**Interview Focus:**
- Why singleton? Thread-safety implementation?
- How to make it extensible for new log destinations?
- Memory leaks prevention in long-running apps

---

## 2. üîÑ Concurrency Essentials

### Producer-Consumer with Batching
```python
# Core Challenge: Handle 100K logs/sec without blocking app threads

# Python-specific implementation:
- queue.Queue(maxsize) for thread-safe operations
- threading.Thread for async consumers  
- asyncio for async I/O operations
- collections.deque for efficient append/pop operations

# Key libraries to know:
- concurrent.futures: ThreadPoolExecutor, ProcessPoolExecutor
- multiprocessing: Queue, Process for CPU-bound tasks
- asyncio: For async/await patterns
```

**FAANG Interview Points:**
- **Locks vs Lock-free**: When to use each, performance implications
- **Thread pools**: Fixed vs cached, sizing strategies  
- **Batching trade-offs**: Latency vs throughput vs memory
- **Overflow handling**: Drop, block, or circuit breaker?

### Essential Concurrency Patterns
```python
# Python-specific patterns:
- threading.local(): Thread-local storage for buffers
- threading.Event: Coordination between threads
- queue.LifoQueue: Stack-like queue for recent items
- weakref: Avoid memory leaks in observer pattern

# Performance considerations:
- GIL impact: I/O bound (threading OK), CPU bound (multiprocessing)
- Queue types: queue.Queue vs multiprocessing.Queue
- Context managers: Automatic resource cleanup
```

## 3. üìÅ File Operations & Storage

### File Management Essentials
```python
# Must-Handle Scenarios:
- Concurrent read/write access using fcntl (Unix) or msvcrt (Windows)
- File rotation with os.rename() for atomic moves
- Context managers for automatic file cleanup
- pathlib for cross-platform path handling

# Python file I/O patterns:
- with open() as f: Automatic cleanup
- os.fsync(): Force write to disk
- mmap: Memory-mapped files for large logs
- tempfile: Atomic writes via temp files
```

**Key Concepts for Interviews:**
- **Memory-mapped files**: `mmap.mmap()` when to use, pros/cons
- **File locking**: `fcntl.flock()` prevent corruption during rotation
- **Atomic operations**: `os.rename()` for atomic file moves
- **Buffering**: `open(buffering=)` parameter implications

---

## 4. üöÄ Performance & Optimization

### Caching Strategy
```python
# Python caching libraries:
- functools.lru_cache: Decorator for function caching
- cachetools: TTLCache, LRUCache with size limits
- Redis-py: Distributed caching
- diskcache: Persistent disk-based cache

# What to Cache:
- Recent logs (collections.OrderedDict for LRU)
- Query results with TTL expiry
- Index metadata in memory

# Cache Levels:
- In-memory (dict/OrderedDict): Hot data
- Disk cache: Warm data  
- Redis/Memcached: Distributed cache
```

### Batching & Buffering
```
Critical Decisions:
- Buffer size: Memory vs latency trade-off
- Flush triggers: Time (5s) OR size (10MB) OR count (1K logs)
- Compression: When to compress, CPU vs disk trade-off
```

---

## 5. üîç Search & Indexing (Core Concepts Only)

### Basic Indexing
```
Essential Indexes:
- Time-based: B+ tree for range queries
- Text search: Simple inverted index
- Log level: Bitmap index

Query Types:
- Range: logs between timestamps
- Filter: ERROR level only
- Text: contains "exception"
```

**Interview Focus:**
- Index storage location (memory vs disk)
- Real-time updates vs batch rebuilds
- Query optimization basics

---

## 6. üì° Message Queue Integration

### Kafka/Queue Basics
```
Key Integration Points:
- Producer: App ‚Üí Queue ‚Üí Consumer ‚Üí File
- Ordering: Partition by thread ID or timestamp
- Durability: At-least-once delivery
- Backpressure: Queue full scenarios
```

**Essential Patterns:**
- **Event-driven**: Async processing
- **Partitioning**: Maintain order within partition
- **Dead letter queue**: Handle failed messages

---

## 7. üåê Scalability Essentials

### Distribution Strategies
```
Scale Patterns:
- Horizontal: Multiple log servers
- Sharding: By time, service, or hash
- Replication: Master-slave for availability
- Load balancing: Consistent hashing
```

### Handle Scale Scenarios
```
1M logs/sec approach:
1. Multiple producers ‚Üí Ring buffers
2. Multiple consumers ‚Üí Parallel processing  
3. Multiple files ‚Üí Sharding strategy
4. Multiple servers ‚Üí Load balancing
```

---

## 8. üõ°Ô∏è Fault Tolerance (Core Only)

### Must-Handle Failures
```
Scenarios:
- Process crash during write ‚Üí WAL recovery
- Disk full ‚Üí Circuit breaker + old log cleanup
- Network partition ‚Üí Local buffering + retry
- File corruption ‚Üí Checksums + backup
```

**Key Patterns:**
- **Circuit breaker**: Prevent cascade failures
- **Retry with backoff**: Handle transient issues
- **Graceful degradation**: Maintain core functionality

---

## 9. üéØ System Design Trade-offs (Interview Gold)

### Critical Decisions You Must Explain

**Sync vs Async Logging:**
- Sync: Guaranteed write, blocks app
- Async: Better performance, risk of loss

**File vs Database Storage:**
- File: Simple, fast writes, harder queries
- DB: Complex queries, slower writes, ACID

**Single File vs Multiple Files:**
- Single: Simpler, locking issues
- Multiple: Parallel writes, complex rotation

**Memory vs Disk Buffering:**
- Memory: Fast, volatile
- Disk: Durable, slower

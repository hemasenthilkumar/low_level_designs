## 1. üèóÔ∏è Core Logging Architecture & Design Patterns

### Basic Logger Design
```
Design a logging framework with these requirements:
- Support multiple log levels (TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL)
- Thread-safe operations
- Configurable output destinations
- Pluggable formatters and filters
```

**Key LLD Concepts:**
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensure single logger instance
- **Factory Pattern**: Create different types of loggers
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different formatting strategies (JSON, XML, plain text)
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Filter chain for log processing
- **Observer Pattern**: Multiple appenders listening to log events

### Advanced Design Questions:
- How do you implement lazy initialization for the logger?

```

**Deep Concurrency Concepts:**

- Recovers from consumer failures
```

**Implementation Deep Dive:**
